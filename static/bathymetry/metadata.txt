  Description:
    Abstract: This bathymetric shapefile contains 10 m contours for the continental shelf and 100 m beyond the 200 m shelf edge.  The contours have been derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), Coastal Relief Models volume 1 and 2.
    Purpose: This data overlay is intended to provide a highly detailed bathymetric contour interval for the NY Bight and Gulf of Maine area.  The bathymetric shapefile contains 10 m contours for the continental shelf and 100 m intervals beyond the 200m shelf edge.  These contours will be used by the Sand and Gravel assessment project to aid in the interpretation and creation of a geologic map of the sedimentary character of the seafloor for the area.

      Process_Description: An image mask of the bathymetry data was created.  The XPACE CONTOUR program was run on the CRM data to create a 100m contour segment of the original data.  The CRM image was then subsetted to create a bathymetry image with values between 11-200 meters and contoured at 10m.  The created contours were then thinned by 50% (VECSEL).
